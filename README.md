Converter
I choose converter calculator because it is used to convert decimal value to binary and hexadecimal .in this project we do that there is interface and have to input boxes example  if  we want to convert decimal value to binary in one box of left side we put the value of decimal and on other side we go the box and select the form of value we want here we want binary so we select binary after clicking on convert button we got the value as per we select .and second thing in this project is this there is swap button means if we want binary to decimal we don't need to go for the change like first select binary after that decimal we just click on swap button the left hand comes to right hand and right hand comes to left hand.and put the value and get the result. it generally do functions  lie convert given data from options : decimal ,octal, binary , hexadecimal to options : decimal ,octal, binary , hexadecimal .  I use  html and css and java script
